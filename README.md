# Project: Adaptive Ensemble Learning for Credit Card Client Creditworthiness Classification
## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the German credit dataset, focusing on classifying creditworthiness using various machine learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing (missing values, outlier, class imbalance), model training, evaluation, and the implementation of an innovative adaptive ensemble learning technique to enhance prediction classification.
## [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit)
The dataset contains information about German credit applicants, including attributes related to their personal, financial, and loan details. The target variable indicates whether the applicant has good or bad credit risk.
# Project Structure
## 1. Data Preprocessing
#### Statistical Analysis: Performed to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
#### Handling Missing Values: Used imputer techniques to handle missing data effectively.
## 2. Model Training
#### Random Forest
#### Logistic Regression
#### Decision Tree
#### K-Fold Validation: Applied to mitigate overfitting and ensure the robustness of the models.
#### Grid Search: Employed to identify the best hyperparameters for each model.
## 3. Ensemble Learning
#### Bagging : Combined multiple versions of a model trained on different subsets of the data to improve stability and accuracy.
#### Boosting : Sequentially trained models where each new model attempts to correct the errors of the previous ones.
#### Stacking : Combined classification from multiple models using a meta-model to improve overall performance
#### Initial Ensemble: Combined the classification of the three models using standard ensemble learning techniques to improve overall performance.
## 4. Adaptive Ensemble Learning
#### Novel Technique: Developed an adaptive ensemble learning method that dynamically excludes models from the ensemble based on a performance threshold. Models with performance below this threshold are removed, optimizing the ensemble's classification performance.
## Conclusion
This project successfully utilized various machine learning techniques to analyze and classify creditworthiness based on the German credit dataset. The introduction of an adaptive ensemble learning approach highlights the potential for enhancing model performance through dynamic adjustments based on individual model accuracy.
